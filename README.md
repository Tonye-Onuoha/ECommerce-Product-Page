## 🛠️ My process

The process was very straightforward. I started by writing out the structure of my HTML.
I then created a CSS stylesheet and broke down the styling of elements one piece at a time using the **flexbox layout
model**, while following the **mobile-first approach**.

To complete the layout, I wrote the **media queries** for the desktop design.
After the design was completed, I added the **logic and interactivity** of the page using JavaScript.
