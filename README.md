## My process

The process was very straightforward. I started by writing out the stucture of my HTML. I then created a CSS stylesheet
and broke down the styling of elements one piece at a time using the flexbox layout model, while following the
mobile-first approach. To complete the layout, I then proceeded to write the media queries for the desktop design. After
the design was completed, I proceeded to add the logic and interactivity of the page using JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox layout model
- Media queries
- JavaScript programming language
